        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Causes of climate change </h1>
        <p> 
           <li> Increase in Greenhouse Gases:<BR></li>
Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) trap heat from the sun in the Earth’s atmosphere, 
creating a “greenhouse effect.” While this effect is natural and necessary to keep our planet warm, excessive amounts of these gases make
 the Earth hotter than usual. Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for electricity, transportation, 
 and factories, release large quantities of CO₂. Livestock farming, rice paddies, and the use of chemical fertilizers produce methane and
  nitrous oxide. The accumulation of these gases intensifies global warming and disrupts climate patterns.</p>
  <p>

<p><li>Deforestation and Land-Use Changes:<BR>
Trees play a crucial role in absorbing CO₂ from the atmosphere. When forests are cut down for agriculture, urban development, or logging, 
this carbon-absorbing ability is lost. Additionally, the carbon stored in trees is released into the atmosphere when they are burned or decay,
 further increasing greenhouse gas levels. Changes in land use, such as draining wetlands, replacing forests with farmland, or expanding cities,
  can alter local climates, reduce biodiversity, and worsen the overall impact of climate change.</p></li>

<p><li>Industrialization and Fossil Fuel Consumption:<br></li>
Factories, power plants, and vehicles burn fossil fuels, producing huge amounts of CO₂ and other harmful pollutants. Industrial growth, 
especially in developing countries, contributes to more emissions each year. These pollutants not only trap heat but also lead to air pollution,
 acid rain, and smog. Rapid industrialization without proper environmental controls accelerates the process of climate change, making the 
 planet warmer faster than natural cycles would.</p>

<p> <li>Agricultural Practices:<br></li>
Agriculture contributes to climate change in several ways. Livestock, such as cows and sheep, produce methane during digestion, while the use
 of chemical fertilizers releases nitrous oxide, both potent greenhouse gases. Waterlogged fields, like rice paddies, also produce methane. 
 Large-scale farming can lead to soil degradation and deforestation, further adding to the problem. Modern farming techniques, while improving
  food production, have increased the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>

<p><li>Natural Factors:<BR>
Natural processes can also affect the Earth’s climate. Volcanic eruptions release gases and ash that can temporarily cool or warm the planet. 
Variations in solar energy can influence temperature over long periods. Natural climate cycles, such as El Niño and La Niña, cause short-term 
changes in weather patterns. However, scientists agree that the rapid climate change observed today is primarily caused by human activities
 rather than these natural factors.</li>
