         <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
         
  <p>
    Climate change is the long-term change in the Earth’s climate, which includes shifts in temperature, rainfall, wind patterns, and other
     weather conditions that we are used to. It is a phenomenon that affects the entire planet, from the frozen poles to tropical regions, and
      impacts all living things, including humans, animals, and plants. Over time, these changes in climate can become very noticeable, even
       in everyday life, such as hotter summers, milder winters, or unusual weather patterns. Scientists study climate change by observing 
       temperature trends, ice sheets, ocean currents, and historical climate data to understand how the Earth’s climate is evolving. It is 
       not just about warmer or colder days; climate change influences natural systems, ecosystems, and the balance of life on Earth in complex 
       ways that can affect future generations.
     </p>
     <p>In recent years, the signs of climate change have become increasingly evident. Weather patterns that were once predictable are now more
         erratic, and extreme events like heatwaves, heavy rains, storms, or floods are occurring more frequently in many regions. Even small 
         changes in average temperatures can trigger large-scale effects, such as the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, or shifts in
          animal and plant habitats. Although the Earth's climate has naturally changed over millions of years due to factors like volcanic
           activity or solar cycles, the rapid pace of recent changes highlights the unusual and urgent nature of the current situation. 
           Observing these patterns helps scientists and communities to prepare for possible future scenarios, understand the impact on
            biodiversity and human life, and develop strategies to adapt to a changing world</p>

            <p>Understanding climate change is crucial because it connects directly to the health of the planet and the well-being of all
                 living beings. It affects resources like water, food, and energy and influences how people live in different parts of the
                  world. By studying climate change, scientists can provide valuable information about trends and risks, helping societies
                   make better decisions for the environment and future generations. Although it is a complex subject, awareness and knowledge
                    about climate change are the first steps toward finding solutions and creating a sustainable future where humans and nature 
                    can thrive together.
