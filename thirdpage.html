        <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Effects of Climate Change</h1>
        <p> <li> Rising Global Temperatures: <BR>
One of the most noticeable effects of climate change is the increase in average temperatures around the world, often called global warming.
 Higher temperatures can lead to longer and more intense heatwaves, making some regions unbearably hot during summer. This not only affects
  human health, increasing heat-related illnesses and deaths, but also impacts agriculture by reducing crop yields and stressing livestock.
   Warmer temperatures also disrupt natural ecosystems, forcing animals and plants to migrate, adapt, or face extinction.</li></p>
   <p> <li> Melting Glaciers and Rising Sea Levels:<BR>
Climate change causes glaciers and polar ice caps to melt faster than before, leading to rising sea levels. This can result in the flooding of
 low-lying coastal areas, erosion of beaches, and loss of habitats for both humans and wildlife. Communities living near coastlines face the 
 risk of displacement, while freshwater supplies can become contaminated with saltwater intrusion. Rising seas also increase the impact of
  storms and hurricanes, making them more destructive when they reach land.
</li></p>
<p> <li>Extreme Weather Events:<BR>
Climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as storms, cyclones, floods, droughts, and wildfires. 
Unpredictable rainfall patterns can cause droughts in some areas while causing heavy flooding in others. Wildfires become more common in dry,
 hot regions, destroying forests, homes, and wildlife habitats. Such extreme events not only harm the environment but also disrupt human lives, 
 damaging infrastructure, reducing food production, and threatening livelihoods.
</li></p>
<p> <li>
    Impact on Ecosystems and Biodiversity:<BR>
Changing climates affect ecosystems by altering habitats, food availability, and migration patterns for animals and plants. Some species may
not survive rapid changes, leading to a loss of biodiversity. Coral reefs, for example, are highly sensitive to temperature changes and can
 bleach and die when waters become too warm. Forests, wetlands, and other natural habitats may shrink or change, affecting the balance of 
 entire ecosystems.
</li></p>
<P> <li>
    Economic and Social Effects:<BR>
Climate change also affects human societies and economies. Agriculture, fishing, and tourism industries can suffer due to unpredictable weather
 and environmental degradation. Extreme weather events destroy infrastructure, homes, and communities, costing countries billions of dollars
  in recovery and adaptation. Additionally, climate change can exacerbate social inequalities, as vulnerable communities often face the
   greatest risks and have the least resources to adapt.
